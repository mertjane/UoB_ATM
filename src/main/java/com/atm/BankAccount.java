/**
 * Abstract representation of a bank account.
 * <p>
 * This abstract class defines the template methods for deposit and withdrawal operations,
 * along with hook methods for customizing account-specific parameters such as limits and commission fees.
 * Concrete subclasses (e.g., GoldAccount, PlatinumAccount, StudentAccount) inherit from this class
 * and override these hook methods to provide specific behaviors and account logics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Modification History:</strong><br>
 * Gur modified the entire class in Task Week 4 (version 1.0.1), made it abstract, set up inheritance for other
 * account classes, and implemented different account logics for deposit, withdrawal, limits, and commissions.
 * <br>
 * Bora modified the class in Task Week 5 (version 3.0.1), changed the account number and password to String to preserve leading zeros.
 * <br>
 * Bora modified the class in Task Week 5 (version 3.0.2), added setAccPasswd method to support password changing functionality.
