 * <strong>Version and Modification History:</strong><br>
 * - Mertcan Task 2 Update 2.0.0: Initial implementation for bank account management.<br>
 * - Gur Task Week 4 version 2.0.1: Modified the deposit, withdraw, getBalance, and getLastMessage methods
 *   to integrate updated account logic.
 * - Bora Task Week 5 version 3.0.1: Modified the login method to use String parameters for account number and password.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: The {@code login} method is partially implemented as part of the lab exercise. Tutors can help with guidance.
